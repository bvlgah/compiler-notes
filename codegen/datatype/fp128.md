# Representation of LLVM fp128

I have planned for some time to write this post to clarify how literals of data
type fp128 are represented in LLVM assembly code. I have been learning about how
argument passing are lowered into machine code for the RISC-V 32-bit target.
Arguments of type fp128 are firstly stored on a caller's stack, and then
addresses of them are passed to a callee. The representation of these arguments
in memory I expected by looking at the LLVM assembly code (of [a test case of
variadic functions](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-17.0.6/llvm/test/CodeGen/RISCV/vararg.ll))
was different from that of the generated machine code. The representation is
weird at first sight and not well-documented in LLVM's manuals.

## An Example of LLVM fp128

As its name indicates, `fp128` (a.k.a. binary128 in the IEEE 754 specification,
see [Quadruple-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format)
on Wikipedia) represents floating-point numbers with 16 bytes (1 bit for sign,
15 bits for exponent and 112 bits for fraction). Here are an example of `fp128`
coming from [LLVM Language Reference Manual](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#single-value-types).
It depicts promotion of a floating-point value with `fpext`, and promotion from
`float` to `double` and from `double` to `fp128` is exercised. Value `3.125` of
type `fp128` should be `0x40009000000000000000000000000000`, and I expected it
would be represented in LLVM assembly with almost the same way. However, it was
written as `0xL00000000000000004000900000000000` actually. It seems `fp128`
values are formated by little-endian order in terms of 64-bit data groups (other
than the prominent byte order or 8-bit data group order).

```
%X = fpext float 3.125 to double         ; yields double:3.125000e+00
%Y = fpext double %X to fp128            ; yields fp128:0xL00000000000000004000900000000000
```

After some investigation, I found that floating-point literals are represented
with [llvm::APFloat](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-17.0.6/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/APFloat.h)
(arbitrary-precision floating-point values) internally which utilize the
functionalities of [llvm::APInt](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-17.0.6/llvm/include/llvm/ADT/APInt.h)
for floating-point arithmetic operations. `0xL00000000000000004000900000000000`
was tokenized in [llvm::LLLexer::Lex0x](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/llvmorg-17.0.6/llvm/lib/AsmParser/LLLexer.cpp#L987)
, and then it was used to create an instance of `llvm::APFloat`.

```cpp
lltok::Kind LLLexer::Lex0x() {
  // ...
  uint64_t Pair[2];
  switch (Kind) {
  default: llvm_unreachable("Unknown kind!");
  case 'K':
    // F80HexFPConstant - x87 long double in hexadecimal format (10 bytes)
    FP80HexToIntPair(TokStart+3, CurPtr, Pair);
    APFloatVal = APFloat(APFloat::x87DoubleExtended(), APInt(80, Pair));
    return lltok::APFloat;
  case 'L':
    // F128HexFPConstant - IEEE 128-bit in hexadecimal format (16 bytes)
    HexToIntPair(TokStart+3, CurPtr, Pair);
    APFloatVal = APFloat(APFloat::IEEEquad(), APInt(128, Pair));
    return lltok::APFloat;
  case 'M':
  // ...
}

void LLLexer::HexToIntPair(const char *Buffer, const char *End,
                           uint64_t Pair[2]) {
  Pair[0] = 0;
  if (End - Buffer >= 16) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++, Buffer++) {
      assert(Buffer != End);
      Pair[0] *= 16;
      Pair[0] += hexDigitValue(*Buffer);
    }
  }
  Pair[1] = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 16 && Buffer != End; i++, Buffer++) {
    Pair[1] *= 16;
    Pair[1] += hexDigitValue(*Buffer);
  }
  if (Buffer != End)
    Error("constant bigger than 128 bits detected!");
}
```

`llvm::APInt` expects bits grouped with 64-bit data trunk in little endianess,
and it is straightforward to represent `fp128` literals in LLVM assembly with
the same way.

## My Thought

I asked myself a question: can it be done better? I think the answer is yes. The
internal implementation of `llvm::APInt` and `llvm::APFloat` can be hidden, and
we can write`fp128` literals with hexadecimals in a common way (`0xL` followed
by 32 hexadecimals with the most significant one coming first). We can twist
`llvm::LLLexer::HexToIntPair` a little as follows:

```cpp
void LLLexer::HexToIntPair(const char *Buffer, const char *End,
                           uint64_t Pair[2]) {
  Pair[1] = 0; // Store data into the buffer in a different order
  if (End - Buffer >= 16) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++, Buffer++) {
      assert(Buffer != End);
      Pair[1] *= 16;
      Pair[1] += hexDigitValue(*Buffer);
    }
  }
  Pair[0] = 0; // Store data into the buffer in a different order
  for (int i = 0; i < 16 && Buffer != End; i++, Buffer++) {
    Pair[0] *= 16;
    Pair[0] += hexDigitValue(*Buffer);
  }
  if (Buffer != End)
    Error("constant bigger than 128 bits detected!");
}
```

Then, adjust the test case accordingly as follows:

```llvm
declare i32 @va5_aligned_stack_callee(i32, ...)

define void @va5_aligned_stack_caller() nounwind {
  %1 = call i32 (i32, ...) @va5_aligned_stack_callee(i32 1, i32 11,
;    fp128 0xLEB851EB851EB851F400091EB851EB851, i32 12, i32 13, i64 20000000000,
    fp128 0xL400091EB851EB851EB851EB851EB851F, i32 12, i32 13, i64 20000000000,
    i32 14, double 2.720000e+00, i32 15, [2 x i32] [i32 16, i32 17])
  ret void
}
```

Result of running the test case `llvm-lit`:

```bash
$ out/release/bin/llvm-lit -v ../llvm-project/llvm/test/CodeGen/RISCV/vararg.ll 
-- Testing: 1 tests, 1 workers --
PASS: LLVM :: CodeGen/RISCV/vararg.ll (1 of 1)

Testing Time: 5.13s
  Passed: 1
```

In my opinion, LLVM assembly code should be designed in favor of readability.
Therefore, the representation of `fp128` values in LLVM assembly is bad for two
reasons:

1. the most significant hexdecimal digit does not come first, which is not hard
to implement but almost impossibe to be fixed (not backward compatible).

2. not well-documented, at least in the LLVM language reference.
